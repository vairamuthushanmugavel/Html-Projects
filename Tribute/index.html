          <strong>Here is some facts about Feynman</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Richard Feynman was one of the most entertaining personalities in
            all of science. He was also one of the most brilliant. Hero to
            physics majors? None better.
          </li>
          <li>
            Feynman was a prankster, ladies’ man, and a straight-talking regular
            joe. But most importantly, he was an adept explainer and teacher of
            complex physics
          </li>
          <li>
            Born in 1918 to secular Jewish parents in Rockaway Beach, Queens,
            Feynman was heavily influenced by his father, a uniform salesman
          </li>
          <li>
            He fixes things with his mind!,” exclaimed one neighbor, since
            Feynman would sit for many minutes before fiddling with the
            electronics, imagining the current running through the circuitry,
            trying to imagine where it was broken.
          </li>
          <li>
            Before college, he derived advanced mathematical concepts using
            notation of his own design. He applied to Columbia but was rejected
            due to their “Jewish quota.” Instead he attended MIT, where he
            published two papers as an undergrad before heading off to Princeton
            for graduate school.
          </li>
          <li>
            Feynman grew restless at Cornell and took a position with Caltech,
            which offered him the opportunity to spend his first year on
            sabbatical in Brazil.
          </li>
          <li>
            Feynman was fond of samba music and learned to play the frigideira,
            drawing on his experience playing bongos. When Feynman got to
            Caltech, he developed the undergrad physics program, which shied
            away from rote learning and unthinking memorization. Instead, his
            goals were clarity and deep understanding.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1965, Feynman won the Nobel Prize in Physics (along with Julian
            Schwinger and Sin’ichirō Tomonaga) for “their fundamental work in
            quantum electrodynamics, with deep-ploughing consequences for the
            physics of elementary particles.”
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1988, Feynman died from cancer at the age of 69. To him, we raise
            a Ninkasi Ground Control, an imperial stout brewed with Oregon
            hazelnuts, star anise, cocoa nibs, Apollo and Comet hops, and—here’s
            the kicker—yeast that went into space on UP Aerospace’s SpaceLoft-9
            rocket. Like Feynman, Ground Control is fun, interesting, and makes
            for one hell of a good story
